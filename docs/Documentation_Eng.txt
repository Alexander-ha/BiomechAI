## Framework purpose 

## Framework tools 
There are many good tools which can help you in solving your 
tasks. As a main ability, you can put in Lagrangians, Hamiltonians,
or just your model to automatically determine generalized coordinates, and equations. 

Your next step can be achieved as you will choose model constraints, and determine main idea of 
model solutions. You can specify such interfaces like 'Equilibrium', 'Dynamics', 'Kinematics', 'Collisions' and 
many others.
